HOPE is a Personal Relationship Manager for helping people connect. It is *NOT A
SOCIAL NETWORK*. Well it is, but with a single user. It is meant to be used
individually, your personal dashboard of life.

** MVP

In its most minimal form, HOPE is a contacts manager with which you can:

- Manage your contacts
- Log basic activities you did with your contacts
  - Calls
  - Meetings
  - Outings
- Set reminders to get in touch with your contacts in future
